Step-by-Step Guide to Running a Next.js Project:
1. Clone the Project
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, you can do so with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Replace username/repository-name with the actual GitHub username and repository name of the project.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:

cd repository-name
3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the dependencies required by the project (this installs the packages listed in package.json):

npm install
If you're using Yarn instead of npm, run:

yarn
4. Run the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev
If you're using Yarn, run:

yarn dev
5. Open the App in Your Browser
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000
You should now be able to see the Next.js project running on your local machine.

Additional Commands:
Build the project for production:

npm run build
This command creates an optimized build of your Next.js application.

Start the project in production mode: After building the project, you can start it in production mode using:

npm run start
Lint the project: To check for code linting errors, use:

npm run lint
Common Issues:
Dependency Issues: If you encounter issues related to missing or conflicting dependencies, try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock), and then run npm install again.

Port Conflicts: If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify another port when starting the server:

PORT=3001 npm run dev
